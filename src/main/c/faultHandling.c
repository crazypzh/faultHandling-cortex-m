  Each of these files includes the respective core_cmN.h. In each of
  those headers, __CORTEX_M is defined to be 0, 3, 4, etc.  We'll use
  that define below, it's more standard than our own build process
  defines: __CORTEX_M3, etc.  But our build process, e.g. make, must
  supply e.g. __CORTEX_M3, __CORTEX_M0PLUS, etc.

 *
 * Structured fault handling on the Cortex-M processor.  
 *
 * When a fault occurs (HardFault or any of MemManage, BusFault,
 * UsageFault), our fault handler collects processor state, formats
 * that state into a 'fault dump table' in a human readable format,
 * then offers it to a pre-registered 'dump processor' function.  

 * The formatted 'fault dump table' looks thus. First N lines are each
 * label+space+hexvalue, for N lines each holding one CPU
 * register. Following those is an optional call stack inference.  On
 * CM3, a dump table looks like this:

r7    2001FFF0
sp    2001FFD0
excrt FFFFFFF9
psr   20000003
hfsr  40000000
cfsr  00020000
mmfar E000ED34
bfar  E000ED38
shcsr 00000000
s.r0  00000002
s.r1  0000000A
s.r2  20000A3C
s.r3  00000000
s.r12 20000B38
s.lr  000001AF
s.pc  00000000
s.psr 40000000
20000FE4 00000317
20000FEC 000002ED
20000FF4 000002AF
20000FFC 00000127

* The call-stack pairs, of which there are 4 above, indicate where in
* the ram the pushed LR was found, and the LR value itself.  Combine
* these values with the .map file for your faulting program (you do
* HAVE the .map file right?) to derive the function call stack.

 * Some of the registers above are missing on CM0/0+ (no hfsr, etc).

 * The dump table is passed to the processor. The processor's job is
 * to decide what to DO with the dump:

 * Print to a 'console'
 * Saved to 'disk' 
 * Stream to an overhead satellite (welcome to MY world)

 * After the processor is done, we take a course of action according
 * to caller's setup: return, loop, reset/reboot or
 * set-debug-breakpoint.
 *
 * To use this faultHandling api in an application, be sure to include
 * at LEAST the HardFault_Handler (given below) and optionally any
 * desired combo of MemManage, BusFault and UsageFault handlers (CM3/4).
 * These functions go in the program's Vector table, and override weak
 * versions supplied by the startup code.
 *
 * Then, to use this api, just call 3 routines early in main:
 *
 * 1 reserve a buffer and set a dump processor:
 *
 * char buf[FAULT_HANDLING_DUMP_SIZE];
 * faultHandlingSetDumpProcessor( buf, myProcessor );
 *
 * 2 (optional), if you want the fault handler to infer a call stack
 * leading up to the fault, supply .text section boundaries, an upper
 * limit on MSP (likely top-of-ram) and an upper limit of PSP
 * (if using rtos, if not, pass 0):

 * faultHandlingSetCallStackParameters( &Vectors, &__etext, &__StackTop, 0 );
 *
 * The symbols Vectors, __etext, __StackTop are likely defined by your linker
 * script, and can be used in code.
 *
 * 3 finally, state what you want to occur at fault time: spin, reboot, return:
 *
 * faultHandlingSetPostFaultAction( REBOOT );
 *
 * Now just wait for your program to blow up!

 * The dump processor is passed the 'fault table' at time of fault.
 * Processor might write to serial console, swo, to disk (?) or even
 * to RAM. In my apps, I have to beam the fault dump over Iridium SBD
 * from a remotely-deployed instrument!
 *
 * For examples, see swoTest.c, consoleTest.c, others in src/test/c
 * 
 * We draw HEAVILY on Chap 12 of Yiu's 3rd ed of Cortex M3/M4
 * Definitive Guide, which should be considered a MUST-READ ;)
 *
 * Why include r7 in the dump?  Well, the usual C function prolog (on
 * function entry) is 'push {r7,lr}', so that the function can itself
 * update these two regs and still get back to caller, via the usual
 * epilogs: 'pop {r7, lr}; bx lr' or the shorter 'pop {r7, pc}'.

 * If our fault is a bad PC, it may be due to the epilog encountering
 * a trashed stack location for the pushed lr.  If we trashed the
 * pushed lr, we may have also trashed the adjacent pushed r7.  If
 * fault dump values for r7, pc are same/related, it lends weight to
 * the notion that the fault is indeed due to stack smashing:

 int stackLocalVar[2];

 stackLocalVar[2] = X;
 stackLocalVar[3] = Y;

 The two erroneous array accesses above may trash the prolog-pushed
 r7, lr, causing the fault to occur at function return (epilog). If r7
 shows X and pc (loaded from lr) shows Y, good bet stack corruption
 occurred.

 @see faultGuru.c for a tool that attempts to make sense of the fault
 table output.
