 * linker-script-defined variable that the application can use for
 * this parameter, for GNU .ld files this is typically '__StackTop'.
 *
 * @param pspTop - top of process stack.  Application should pass 0 if
 * not using the process stack.  0 can be passed also if the
 * application just doesn't know a good value for top of process
 * stack.  We will just use mspTop.
 *
 * Only threads, under an RTOS, would use the process stack. Not
