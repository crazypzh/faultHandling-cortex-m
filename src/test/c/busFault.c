 * Fault capture using the faultHandling api, where the processing of
 * the fault is to 'export the fault dump' by writing it to a uart on
 * the SiliconLabs STK3700 starter kit.  The STK3700 uses an
 * EFM32GG990F1024 cpu.
 *
 * We are viewing that uart as the 'serial console' of that board, so
 * the dump export is as close to a 'printf' as such a board can
 * mimic. 

 * On the STK3700, Expansion Header pin 4 (USART1 Tx) is PD0 while pin
 * 6 (USART1 Rx) is PD1. These pins are route/location 1 for that
 * USART.  See the STK3700 data sheet.

 * Hook up a ttl-usb cable to your host, and open e.g. minicom (or
 * just cat!) at 115200 and see the fault dump appear as the stk3700
 * end keels over with a fault!
