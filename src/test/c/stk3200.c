 * Helper for fault handling api test cases that run on a SiliconLabs
 * stk3200 starter kit board.  That board contains a ZeroGecko CPU, a
 * CM0plus.

 * https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/mcu/32-bit/efm32zg-starter-kit?tab=overview 

 * Here we provide TWO routines for test cases:

 * initConsole() - set up the CMU, GPIO and USART peripherals such 
 * that USART1 is pinned out to the stk3200's Expansion Header on pins
 * 4 (Tx) and 6 (Rx). We are viewing that uart as the 'serial console'
 * of that board.

 * consoleWrite( char* s ) - write a supplied string to the serial console.
 *
 * Hook up a ttl-usb cable to your host, and open
 * e.g. minicom/teraterm (or just cat!) at 115200 baud, 8N1, and see
 * any output written by the stk3200's consoleWrite routine.
 *
 * $ stty -F /dev/ttyXXX 115200 -echo
 * $ cat /dev/ttyXXX
 */
